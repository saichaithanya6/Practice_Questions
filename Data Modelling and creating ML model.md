Build a predictive model for customer churn based on the information provided in the images.

#### 1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

Data Cleaning: - Handle Missing Values: - Imputation: For numerical features, use methods like mean, median, or mode imputation. For categorical features, use techniques like frequent category imputation or creating a new category for missing values.
- Consider K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation: If you have a large dataset and want to leverage relationships between features, KNN can be effective.

Deal with Categorical Variables:

One-Hot Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical ones. For example, "region" could be encoded as separate binary columns (e.g., "region_North", "region_South", etc.).

Label Encoding: Assign a unique integer to each category. This is generally used for ordinal variables where there's an inherent order (e.g., low, medium, high).

Handle Outliers: Identify and address outliers using methods like IQR (Interquartile Range) or visualization techniques. Outliers can significantly impact model performance.

Class Imbalance:

Oversampling (SMOTE): Create synthetic samples of the minority class (churned customers) to balance the dataset.

Undersampling: Remove samples from the majority class (non-churned customers). However, this can lead to information loss.

Weighted Loss Functions: Adjust the loss function during model training to give more weight to the minority class.

#### 2. Feature Engineering

Derive New Features:

Subscription Duration: Calculate the duration of the subscription (in months or days).

Recency: Calculate the time since the last interaction or payment.

Frequency: Calculate the number of interactions or payments within a specific time frame.

Monetary Value: Calculate the total revenue generated from a customer.

Interaction Frequency: Calculate the frequency of customer support interactions.

Payment History: Create features like payment delays or payment failures.

Customer Support Interactions: - Analyze the reason for support interactions (e.g., technical issues, billing questions).

Create features like "number of support tickets" or "average resolution time."
Domain-Specific Features:

Consider features relevant to the telecommunications industry, such as data usage patterns, call duration, and service interruptions.

#### 3. Model Selection and Training

Consider these algorithms:

Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective model for binary classification.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that can handle non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Powerful algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM can achieve high accuracy.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Can be effective for complex decision boundaries.
Neural Networks: Can learn complex patterns but require careful tuning and may be computationally expensive.
Model Tuning:

Use techniques like grid search or randomized search to find the best hyperparameters for the chosen algorithm.
Evaluate model performance using cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

#### 4. Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy: Overall proportion of correct predictions.

Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.

Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive 1  instances
